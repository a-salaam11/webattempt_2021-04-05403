    <h3>Dr.Ashley Normann-Alumni(2014)</h3>
    <p><i><strong>"Deviated me from a bill-paying career to a Life-fulfilling one.</strong>"Ever since
    my enrollment in Enlightment-School.My whole perspective on how to approach education was changed and
    I heavily got obsessed with being a doctor.All my past education was solely based on Competition rather
    than collaboration,Not to say that it was my fault but rather the fault of the society that I grew from.
    All in all,<i>Being a student at Enlightment-Schools is the best decision and experience of my entire life.</i>

    <h3>Kelly Cumberbatch(Psychology-Expert)-Alumni(2013)</h3>
    <p><i><strong>"If you wanna learn from the best,Enlightment-Schools is for You."</strong>I
    understand some people will take these words as if I am promoting Enlightment-School but truth be-told,
  these words come deeply from the bottom of my something.I was given a chance to be a part of this amazing school with a full-
funded scholarship just because I was good at chess.What kind of school does that!Well,Enlightment-School
does that.It takes your talent and nourishes it.Not only am I right now good at chess but also so
darn good at psychology that I had a meeting with Dr.Jordan Peterson at his house.Enough of me Rumbling,Join the school
and see for yourself!</i></p>

    <h3>Magrett Shitu(Lecturer)-Alumni(2014)</h3>
    <p><i><strong>"I never knew that teaching was more of a thing to me till I came to Enlightment-Schools."</strong>On being a
    kid,I found teaching as the worst career path a person could ever pursue.This wrong perspective all changed when I joined Enlightment-
  School. The school showed me that with the appropriate methodology,teaching is the dopest career out there.
What!You might ask yourself what Enlightment Schools does that most schools don't.Well,it's simple.
Consider the following analogy,Imagine a doctor prescribing the same medicine to different kinds of patients!The
results would be horrific.That's for sure!.Enlightment-School understands that no two children are the same.Don't take
my words for it,Just ask any parent with more than one child.Therefore,Enlightment-School applies several
teaching methodologies each geared towards a respective kind of students.I can't stress enough how
important and effective this method is in learning.All in all, I would like to say "WELCOME TO ENLIGHTMENT-SCHOOL,<strong>A
place where a fish is no longer forced to climb a tree.</strong>"</i></p>
