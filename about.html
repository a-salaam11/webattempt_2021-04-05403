    <div class="fea-box">
 <h3>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</h3>
 <p>The Idea of the establishment of <strong>Enlightment-Schools</strong> came into existence during the early
 2009.This idea came about after an incidence where a certain kid committed suicide just because of failing
his Ordinary-level Final Exams.This idea was then presented to the legitmate sponsors and they approved it.
Finally,In 2012,20th January <strong>Enlightment-Schools</strong> was established.</p>
    <div class="fea-box">
 <h3>LEVELS OF EDUCATION OFFERED</h3>
 <p>In the Main-campus of <strong>Enlightment-Schools</strong> situated at Salasala,the School only offers
 Ordinary-level education and therefore amits only Odinary-level students.Since the emergence of outstanding <strong> Alumni</strong> from the school,there has
been an increament in the number of sponsors.Therefore,the school is planning on developing an Advanced-level Campus
and ultimately spreading all over the country and the continent at Large.</p>

    <div class="fea-box">
 <h3>VISION OF THE SCHOOL</h3>
 <p>It is undeniable fact that most schools are conservative and they continue with the traditional methods
 of <strong>judging students' abilities on a piece of paper</strong> which is similar to a doctor prescribing the same medicine to
all of his or her patients.With over <strong>20+ Staff Members and over 6+ subjects taught,</strong>Our school aims to unlock the true potential of children via boosting their creativity
and imagination and emphasizing collaboration among them instead of competition.Welcome to
<strong>Enlightment-Schools,</strong> A place where a fish is no longer forced to climb a tree.</p>
